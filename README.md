Migrations
==========

Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner. 
You could edit fragments of SQL by hand, but you would then be responsible for telling other developers 
that they need to go and run them. Youâ€™d also have to keep track of which changes need to be run against 
the production machines next time you deploy. [by rubyonrails.org](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)


Getting started & Documentation
===========

It's a tool, a PHP library based on Zend Framework, which could be used in your application to migrate your database.
It works with MySQL out of the box, but not limited to it.

The idea was borrowed from the migration system built into Ruby on Rails. 

Newest Zend Framework version (1.11.11) is used as the example application, but lower versions should work as well.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/tripsta/wink-db-migrations/wiki) 
for the complete documentation!
